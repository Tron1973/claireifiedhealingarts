										<h3>RECONNECTIVE HEALING<p class="trademark-two">®</p></h3>
										<h4>What is Reconnective Healing?</h4>

                                        <p>
                                            Reconnective Healing is a return to Wholeness, it is Life Progress. At the forefront of its field, it is a new level of healing that scientists and researchers feel we can access for the very first time. Reconnective Healing completely transcends traditional energy healing techniques. It allows us to let go of the concept, approach and even the need for technique itself while including the benefits of all known energy healing methods. It is neither a therapy nor a treatment, as it does not focus on symptoms. It is something much, much more.</p>

                                            <p>Reconnective Healing is a return to an optimal state of balance that results from interacting with its fully comprehensive spectrum of frequencies consisting of Energy, Light & Information™. Recent studies have even shown that this spectrum brings about a distinctly beneficial transformation in our DNA. RH is received in it’s highest form when we allow ourselves to release expectation. It restores coherence and harmony in our lives and transforms our bodies, hearts, minds, and souls – physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and in many ways that otherwise may seem impossible.</p>

                                            <p>Reconnective Healing is an established non-touch energy healing approach that encompasses the benefits of all known techniques without any complicated steps, equipment, procedures or rituals. It is scientifically supported and known to facilitate significant advancement in all arenas of daily life. This includes our physical wellbeing, mental clarity, emotional inner peace and spiritual life progress! This is where we meet our essential self.</p>

                                            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                                            <h4>How many sessions are necessary before I notice anything?</h4> 
                                                <p>It varies upon the person receiving the healing, but changes are occurring regardless. It is suggested that you experience between one to three sessions. Then let go and allow the healing to continue to transform.</p>

                                            <h4>Is Reconnective Healing a proven science? </h4>
                                                <p>Reconnective Healing has been confirmed and documented in more than a dozen international studies. And science continues to explore how it works. Scientists have found that when the Reconnective Healing frequencies entrain with our energy bodies we emit and vibrate at a higher and more coherent and harmonic level of light. This has been shown to restructure our DNA, resulting in measurably higher levels of bio-photonic light emission. Researcher and Stanford Professor Emeritus Dr. William Tiller says that when information carried through the Reconnective Healing frequencies is introduced, it creates coherence, order, and a greater harmony and balance within us.</p>

                                            <h4>What can I expect during a Reconnective Healing session? What’s the best way to prepare for it? What can I do to allow it to be most effective?</h4>
                                                <p>Everyone’s experience with Reconnective Healing is unique. Often healings are reported in an instant in just one session. Sometimes it takes a bit longer for a healing to unfold. As a general rule, the less you expect, the more you receive. Just wear comfortable clothes and socks as you’ll be removing your shoes.</p>

                                            <h4>Is Reconnective Healing like Reiki or Qigong?</h4>
                                                <p>Reiki and Qigong, just like other energy healing modalities, access various different subsets or portions of the energy field. Reconnective Healing accesses the entirety of the energy field, and brings you beyond into newer aspects of light and information. What does this mean to you? It means that the Reconnective Healing frequencies bring you all the gifts of all our known energy healing techniques and then brings you far beyond them. And this is a truly wonderful gift!</p>

										<h3>THE PERSONAL RECONNECTION</h3>
										<h4>What is The Personal Reconnection?</h4>

                                        <p>The Personal Reconnection utilizes the frequencies of Reconnective Healing, but is very precise and differs in its application. It is a focused formation, reconnecting the gridwork of your body to the ley lines of our planet, and Reconnecting these grids to the universal grid in all dimensions of time and space.</p>

                                        <p>In your Personal Reconnection, you are reconnecting to a timeless system of intelligence, your master vibration and your evolution. You are actively choosing to access all that you have learned throughout your lifetimes, in this dimension, and beyond. It is an ongoing process, and it will continue to unfold as you begin to make new choices on your life path, moving into your Life Progress. Many who have experienced their Personal Reconnection simply say, “Life is… easier”.</p>

                                        <p>The Personal Reconnection is facilitated in two separate sessions on two separate days. Your second session must be completed within approximately three days after the first session. Receiving your Personal Reconnection is a choice. Not everyone chooses to shift their life at this accelerated pace. The Personal Reconnection is facilitated once in a lifetime.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>I am a Reconnective Healing Foundational Practitioner and a Reconnection-Certified Practitioner.</p>
